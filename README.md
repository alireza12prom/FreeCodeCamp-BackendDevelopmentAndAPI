# FreeCodeCamp - Back End Development and APIs

I tried to solve the challenges with the idea of using the least dependencies and so I solved them by javascript built-in features as much as I could. Feel free to use!

#### Challenges

- [Timestamp Microservice](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/back-end-development-and-apis-projects/timestamp-microservice)
- [Request Header Parser Microservice](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/back-end-development-and-apis-projects/request-header-parser-microservice)
- [URL Shortener Microservice](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/back-end-development-and-apis-projects/url-shortener-microservice)
- [Exercise Tracker](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/back-end-development-and-apis-projects/exercise-tracker)
- [File Metadata Microservice](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/back-end-development-and-apis-projects/file-metadata-microservice)

It took me less than a day to solve them. You can find my certification [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/fcccd5cd341-542b-4890-8f01-c7e4fc8f9cf2/back-end-development-and-apis). Before checking out my solutions, try to solve them on you own ðŸ˜¼.
